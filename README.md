# IMA207--Telecom-Paris

This course is structured in two parts.
The first part covers new concepts in the Image field (such as coherent imaging and multiplicative noise, source separation, etc.), using remote sensing applications as a common thread (SAR - synthetic aperture radar - imaging, multi-spectral optical imaging, hyper-spectral imaging). The course is illustrated by a large number of practical exercises on a Jupyter notebook.
The other part of the course focuses on industrial applications of image processing and analysis, with presentations given by speakers from various companies on the following subjects (by way of illustration): biometrics, photography, non-destructive testing, autonomous vehicles, etc.

### Objectives

A first pedagogical objective of this course is to familiarize students with new concepts: coherent imaging and its specificities, source separation and associated methods. This objective is achieved through the example of remote sensing imagery, which also enables students to acquire an understanding of this fast-growing field.

A second objective is to enable students to make the link between the knowledge of image processing and analysis acquired during the Image course and the skills they will need to apply in their future careers as image processing engineers.
